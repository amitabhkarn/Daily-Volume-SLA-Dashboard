# 📊 Daily-Volume-SLA-Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🔹 Overview
This project showcases a **Daily Procurement Performance Dashboard** developed in **Power BI** for the **client**.  
Previously, there was **no consolidated dashboard** available to track **daily and periodic volumes, SLA percentages, and agent-level performance** across procurement and support processes.  
Reporting was done manually via Excel slides, which was time-consuming and error-prone.  

The Power BI solution provides **real-time, accurate, and visually engaging dashboards**, improving operational visibility and reducing manual reporting effort.
